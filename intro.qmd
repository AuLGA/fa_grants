Financial Assistance Grants (FA Grants) are a funding mechanism used by the Commonwealth government to distribute funding to Australia's 538 local councils. Funding for the FA grant program has evolved since its initial introduction, and funding has not kept up with an increase in costs for local councils. 

The FA Grant distribution process consists of three components: a local road network component; a general purpose component; and a per capita minimum grant component. This component requires every council to be given at least 30% of what their grant would be if FA grants were distributed on a per capita basis. 

This allocation mechanism is controversial with our members (Australia's 538 local governments), as regional and rural councils see the third of these components as a way to funnel money towards urban and peri-urban councils, even though they are not as financially reliant on FA grants as their regional and rural counterparts. 

ALGA holds a long standing view that a more practical way to achieve greater financial sustainability for councils is to increase the size of the pie rather than how it is sliced. This is reflected in ALGA's call for a return to FA Grants being equal to 1% of Commonwealth taxation revenue. 

In this report, we break from this view to consider the impacts of a change to the minimum allocation. This is done through modelling the per capita gains and losses of a shift from 30%, considering lower minimums and the removal of a minimum allocation in its entirety. 

Additional to our analysis of council impacts, we will also perform a macroeconomic modelling of how these changes could impact the broader economy. The goal of this analysis is to provide insights into a change to the distribution process that would optimise financial sustainability whilst also not negatively impacting GDP.
