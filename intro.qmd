Financial Assistance Grants (FA Grants) are a funding mechanism used by the Commonwealth government to distribute funding to Australia's 538 local councils. Funding for the FA grant program has evolved since its initial introduction, and the program has not kept up with the expanding role that local councils play in our every day lives. 

The FA Grant distribution process consists of three components: a local road network component; a general purpose component; and a per capita minimum grant component. This final component requires every council to be given at least 30% of what their grant would be if FA grants were distributed on a purely per capita basis. 

The minimum allocation requirement is controversial with our members (Australia's 538 local governments), as regional and rural councils see it as a way to funnel money towards urban and peri-urban councils, even though they are not as financially reliant on FA grants as their regional and rural counterparts. This is an understandable perspective, given inner city councils often run in surplus, with a wide range of revenue streams due to high economic activity and a more dense populus.

ALGA holds a long standing view that a more practical way to achieve greater financial sustainability for councils is to increase the size of the pie rather than how it is sliced. This is reflected in ALGA's call for a return to FA Grants being equal to 1% of Commonwealth taxation revenue. 

In this report, we break from this view to consider the impacts of a change to the minimum allocation. We achieve this through modelling the per capita gains and losses of a shift from 30%, considering a lower requirement; and the removal of a minimum allocation in its entirety. 

Building off this analysis, we will also perform a macroeconomic modelling of how these changes could impact the broader economy. 
 
The goal of this analysis is to provide insights into what type of change to the distribution process would optimise the financial sustainability of local governments, whilst also contributing to economic growth and productivity.
