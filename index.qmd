# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a repository - a knowledge base if you will, of the Financial Assistance Grants system to Local Government Councils. 

In the first section of the book, we explore the different methods employed by state grants commissions to determine the quantum of the grant allocaiton. 

The second section then explores issues commonly reported by councils. We also explore debates surrounding optimal grant allocation strategies.
