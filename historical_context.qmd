Financial Assistance Grants were originally introduced by the Whitlam government, to allow general purpose grants to councils that were untied. 

This sytem of general purpose grants was legislated in 1986, before its final form was reached in 1995 under the Keating government. Since then, the principles and methods for allocating FA grants have not changed. 

During the Abbott Government, and for parts of the Turnbull Government, between 2014-2017, FA grant indexing was paused. This resulted in a real decline in money for councils.

Since the program's inception, the federal government has provided over $74 billion of untied funding. This funding has gone towards the critical work that local councils do to provide livable, sustainable communities and essential services across Australia.
